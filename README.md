The Simplex Method is one of the important methods in solving linear programming problems. It is used to find the optimal solution to a set of linear constraints with a linear objective function.

The simple method is fast and efficient in finding solutions to linear programming problems, especially when the dimensions are large. Here are general directions for the simple method:

Converting the problem to standard form: The problem is converted to standard form where the objective function and constraints are presented as sets of linear equations.

Finding an Initial Feasible Solution: A simple method requires a feasible starting point to start from. Usually, a possible starting point is found by guessing the values or using other methods.

Corner Point Calculation: The simple method navigates through the corner points formed by the set of constraints. At each step, the value of the objective function is optimized by moving to a new corner point.

New point selection: The next corner point is chosen using a specific selection rule (such as the least cost or least value rule).

Stopping Criterion Test: At each step it is checked whether the current point achieves the optimal solution. If the optimal solution is not reached, the previous steps will continue to be applied until the optimal solution is reached.

Optimal solution: Once the point that achieves the optimal solution is reached, the values of the variables at this point can be relied upon as the final solution to the problem.
